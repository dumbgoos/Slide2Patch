# Slide2Patch üî¨üñºÔ∏è

**Slide2Patch** is an open-source toolkit designed for beginners in digital pathology. It converts KFB slides to the widely used SVS format, extracts Regions of Interest (ROIs) using annotation data, and subdivides them into smaller patches for detailed analysis.

## Overview üöÄ

Digital pathology often requires processing large, high-resolution slides. **Slide2Patch** simplifies this process by:
- Converting proprietary KFB slides to the standard SVS format.
- Segmenting SVS images based on annotation data to extract precise ROIs.
- Dividing each ROI into smaller patches suitable for machine learning, diagnostics, or further image analysis.

Whether you're a researcher, clinician, or developer, Slide2Patch streamlines your workflow from raw slide data to actionable image patches.
